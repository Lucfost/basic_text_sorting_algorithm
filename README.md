If you are compiling 'g++ -std=c++20' and you get '-std=c++03' error, you need to update the 'gcc' version. 
Probably 'GCC 8' version will solve the problem. 
If you get a compilation error in Visual Studio, select Project->ProjectProperties->General->C++LanguageStandard ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)
